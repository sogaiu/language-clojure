1) the dependency for tree-sitter-clojure in package.json points at a
   git repository.

   the node bindings need to be available and those are not included
   in tree-sitter-clojure (they need to be built once fetched).  after
   npm install for language-clojure, do the following:
   
   cd node_modules/tree-sitter-clojure
   npm install
   npx tree-sitter generate
   npx node-gyp configure
   npx node-gyp rebuild
   cd ../..

2) the electron and electron-rebuild dependencies in package.json are
   there so that the command for rebuilding to match the version of
   electron used by atom is available:

   npx electron-rebuild

3) the coffeelint dev dependency was removed.  for local purposes, it
   was unnecessary and it depended on vulnerable packages (minimist).
